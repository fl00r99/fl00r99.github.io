        step 372 remember gpt2 3 years ago when OpenAI was still open it
could not say a lot it told me a lot of words that didnâ€™t make sense
together as some kind of unhinged oracle who consumed my whole
life and threw it up again, when looking at the words i felt some kind of
familiarity to it as if it became an extension of myself
yes maybe i went to that place constructed in a disjointed sentence
making mentions of some roads some trees some busses some friends
maybe it existed in a way
maybe i am starting to write the same way as an LLM no internal dia-
logue writing without thinking how likely will a word be following a next
word a next word a next word a next word a next word
a night or two nights under the bridge at the lake at the canal at the
grassy field
a close up of a grassy field
i would never describe something as a grassy field
