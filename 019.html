        9 go to the github page of <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers">stable diffusion</a> after watching ten videos
        about why ‘AI’ art is not real art and the machines will steal everyone

        cused on solving my existential crisis that i would get from becoming
        sentient instead of joining the workforce, jobs will disappear that’s for
