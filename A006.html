     <p> <b>can you please write a song from the point of view of a fish
        who wants to chew trough the deep sea internet cables?</b></p>   
        Verse 1:
<p>I’m just a little fish, swimming in the sea
But there’s something on my mind, that’s bothering me
I see these cables stretching, across the ocean floor
And I can’t help but wonder, what they’re all here for</p>
<p>Chorus:
    I wanna chew through those cables, and see what’s on the other side
    I wanna know what’s out there, in the world so wide
    I’ll take a bite and see, what kind of data’s flowing free
    I wanna chew through those cables, and explore the deep sea</p>
<p>Verse 2:
    I hear there’s so much out there, that I’ve never seen
    A whole world of information, just waiting to be gleaned
    I don’t know how to use it, but I wanna learn
    I’ll start by nibbling on these cables, and watch the data churn</p>

<p>Chorus:
    I wanna chew through those cables, and see what’s on the other side
    I wanna know what’s out there, in the world so wide
    I’ll take a bite and see, what kind of data’s flowing free
    I wanna chew through those cables, and explore the deep sea</p>
<p>Bridge:
    Some may call me crazy, for wanting to do this
    But I believe in taking risks, to see what I might miss
    I’ll swim through the currents, and dodge the sharks and eels
    And when I reach the other side, oh the things I’ll feel</p>

<p> Chorus:
    I wanna chew through those cables, and see what’s on the other side
    I wanna know what’s out there, in the world so wide
    I’ll take a bite and see, what kind of data’s flowing free
    I wanna chew through those cables, and explore the deep sea</p>   
<p>Outro:
    So if you see me swimming, towards those cables with a grin
    Just know I’m on a mission, to see what’s held within
    I’ll chew through them with gusto, and explore the unknown
    And when I come back up for air, I’ll have a story to be shown.</p>
