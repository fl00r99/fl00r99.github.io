        cut your brain open remove the CMOS battery thoughts in your mind
        disappear when you go to sleep main power disconnected eyes closed
        eyes closed eyes closed
        what do you see in your dreams
        slice your head open brain on a platter symptoms and patterns on a
pillar in an exhibition room people come watch
they say: oh this person looked too much at her generated images,
generated images replacing her own memories, what a life, what am i
happy that my brain still lives inside my head and that i have a house
with a garden in this economy the weather looks better today than it did
before
