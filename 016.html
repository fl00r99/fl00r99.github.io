 </div> 9there are different ways to apply thermal paste watch a lot of <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sog0M9OrlME">youtube</a>
 tutorials some say apply it as a dot in the middle some say apply it as a
 x then it will spread better and cover everything and then it will be nice
 actually metal to metal would be best but that's not possible because there are tiny gaps in the metal so if you use the thermal paste
 then it fills the tiny gaps in between so the heat is distributed more
 accurately
