look at the shadows the sun is shining right now it has been a long time
since it ever shone
moving and moving on the pavement the trees are breathing through
the wind
the generated artificial shadows also move but in a different way it is
not moving more like morphing into each other but come to think of it
now, thats maybe how everything moves when we donâ€™t notice it
