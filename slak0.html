 </div> "Due to the forward nature of GPT-4’s output production, the only
 way for the model to do such far-ahead planning is to rely on its internal representations and parameters to
 solve problems that might require more complex or iterative procedures.
 In what comes next we will try to argue that one of the main limitations of the model is that the
 architecture does not allow for an “inner dialogue” or a “scratchpad”, beyond its internal representations,
 that could enable it to perform multi-step computations or store intermediate results. We will see that,
 while in some cases this limitation can be remedied by using a different prompt, there are others where this
 limitation cannot be mitigated."
